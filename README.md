**GAME INTRODUCTION:**
  - This is our CSE102 Course Project, creating the classic game found in older Nokia phones, called "Bounce_Classic"
  - The game consists of three levels and in order to complete each level, the player must navigate the ball through each of the hoops found in the levels.
  - Upon passing through all the hoops, the player can proceed to the next level by going through the portal in each level.
  - Lives and Checkpoints are available in each level, to aid the player in case of any deaths.
  - Each level also consists of traps (Both static and dynamic) which, upon collision, will pop the player's ball.
  - Everytime the ball pops, a life drops from the player, and if that life_count reaches 0, the player fails to complete the level and has to restart.
  - The new leaderboard system in this game is based upon "Fastest total time to complete all 3 levels", that is, the player that has the least amount of time to complete all 3 levels (Regardless of the chronology) will be deemed first, and so on.
  - This leaderboard system is not same as the traditional scoring system of the original Bounce_Classic game, because in that game there is a limited amount of resources in each level, meaning that the maximum highscore in each level is capped, which does not make for a good basis of evaluation.
  - We have also added a "Save" function, to save where the ball last left off. And if there is a save file, the player can load that save and continue from where he left.
